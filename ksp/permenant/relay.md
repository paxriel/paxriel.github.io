## Relays (000x Series)

The 000x series relays are short range relays, only capable of transmitting data within the Kerbin system.
All the relays on each planet are 90 degrees to the plane of the other relays.
This series is only used within the Kerbin system. It is superseded by the 001x Series relays and are terminated in Event 1.

## Relays (001x Series)

The 001x series relays are long range relays, capable of transmitting large quantities of data.
For planets, each would have 3 relay groups, with each group having 90 degrees of rotation from the plane of other groups. Within each group, all the relays are 45 degrees to each other.
For moons, the relay system would be similar to that of the 000x series, with all the relays being at 90 degrees to the plane of other relays.
This series is only used within the Kerbin system and is now superseded by the 002x and 003x series.

## Relays (002x Series)

The 002x series relays has the same communication system as the 001x relays. However, they have no solar panels, and instead consist of RTGs and upgraded batteries, allowing them to function in places without sufficient sunlight.
Its deployment system is exactly the same as that of the 001x relays.
This series is deployed to all moons and satellites within the Duna, Dres, Jool and Eeloo systems.

## Relays (003x Series)

The 002x series relays would be similar to the 002x relays, except it also contains cooling systems to allow it to survive in high temperature environments.
Its deployment system is exactly the same as that of the 001x relays.
This series is deployed to Moho and Eve due to its proximity to Kerbol.
